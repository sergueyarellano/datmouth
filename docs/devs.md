# Getting started


Clone the repo and `npm install` to install node dependencies.

Now you can open a terminal and 

```
node client.js yourtopic -s 1
```

and in another terminal

```
node client.js yourtopic -s 2
```

You can always make `cli.js` executable with 
```
$ chmod +x cli.js
$ ./cli.js test -s 1
$ ./cli.js test -s 2
```
